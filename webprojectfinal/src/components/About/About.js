            With a career spanning over 18 years, Camille Codorniu, has been a
            jewelry designer to several high profile brands including: Kenneth
            Cole, Giorgio Armani, Fossil Co. and Michael Kors.
            <br />
            <br />
            After a successful career in jewelry design, Camille made the hard
            decision to leave corporate after the birth of her second son.{" "}
            <br />
            <br />
            In 2017 the designer launched her own eponymous dream brand, Camille
            Jewelry. Her ethereal pieces have been meticulously designed with a
            contemporary twist and curated specifically for the modern women,
            creative’s and influencers. The collections are, as Camille says, “
            the perfect balance of simplicity, femininity and with a modern
            edge.”
            <br />
            <br />
            Our craftsmanship and ability to source high quality and unique
            stones make the pieces speak for themselves. "During my career I’ve
            been fortunate to work with some of the best manufacturers and
            artisans around the world, while learning the intricate techniques
            of jewelry design, says Codorniu.
            <br />
            <br />
            The brand initially started as a luxury fashion jewelry ( costume)
            brand designed with fine jewelry detailing. As the demand grew,
            Camille introduced a demi- fine & fine jewelry capsule collection
            and combined all categories under one brand umbrella. "Who says you
            can't layer a fashion ring paired with a emerald & diamond ring?",
            says Camille. Think of your favorite influencer who wears a Zara T
            shirt paired with a Chanel handbag. There are no rules on how to
            accessorize. The brand is designed so that you can easily layer
            together regardless of price point or category. The quality and
            workmanship in each category are all treated the same...Luxe!
            <br />
            <br />
            After working in NYC for over 18 years, Camille felt it was
            important to keep her manufacturing local and in the heart of the
            city. All her jewelry is designed and handmade supporting local
            craftsmen in the city she loves best. Her fashion-forward, yet
            classic, powerful designs and curated selections are the ultimate
            expression of the brand. Each item displays her creative use of
            color, technique and prides herself on attention to detail. From
            choosing the stones to putting finishing touches, she strives to
            ensure each and every handmade piece embodies the brands aesthetic.{" "}
